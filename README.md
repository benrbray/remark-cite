# `remark-cite`

Following [convention](https://github.com/micromark/micromark/discussions/56), this repository contains **three separate `npm` packages** related to support for [Pandoc-style](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-citations) citation syntax for the `remark` Markdown parser.

* `micromark-extension-cite` 

## Contributing

Pull requests for bugfixes or new features / options are welcome.  Be aware that changes to the syntax extension `micromark-extension-cite` may also have an impact on the other two packages, and you will need to test all three.
